## CMOS RCA-16
Project for EE 457 - Digital Integrated Circuits Design with Professor Bruce Kim at the City College of New York.
## About The Project
- In this project, we will be designing a CMOS of a 16-Bit Ripple Carry Adder using Electric.
- By using the Electric software, we’ll be creating two different designs, a schematic design and a layout design.
- In order to test if our designs are correct, we’ll be generating waveforms to test for correctness by giving a specific input and expecting a certain output.
- We’ll be generating the waveforms using two different software, IRSIM and LTSPICE. The two different software would help support our design by increasing our test methods and providing us different test properties.
- After obtaining the waveforms for the two different design, we’ll compare them and observe their similarities and differences.
